    <h3>So How Flat Really Is Kansas?</h3>



    <p class="secondTabText">So as you may already know, Kansas is pretty damn flat. Just look at the picture I put below. But just how flat is this Sunflower State? Well luckily, other people have asked this question! Utah State University, and they even did the service of measuring and calculating just how flat this state is. The way they did this was, well first they purchased a well-cooked pancake from a local restaurant, the International House of Pancakes, and prepared it for analysis by separating a 2-cm wide sample strip that had not had time to desiccate. They collected macro-pancake topography through digital image processing of a pancake image and ruler for scale calibration. Then they measured a west-east profile across Kansas taken from merged 1:250,000 scale digital elevation model (DEM) data from the United States Geological Survey. In general, the spacing between adjacent elevation points on the landscape transects was approximately 90 meters. They extracted surface transects and flatness estimates from the Kansas and pancake DEM data using a geographic information system.

      <p class="secondTabText2"> The best part about this is Kansas isn't even the flattest state in the U.S. It isn't even in the top 5. It's actually in the 7th. The flattest state in the U.S. is really Florida. By any measurement Florida is the flattest because its highest point is only 345 feet above sea level.
